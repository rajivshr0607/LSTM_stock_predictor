# LSTM_stock_predictor
## Unit_14
1. LSTM_stock_predictor_closing has the lower loss(0.0074 with window_size 0f 10 and 0.0069 with window_size of 8 VS 0.0893 and 0.0800 repectively.)
2. LSTM_stock_predictor_closing tracks the actual values better which we can clearly see on the plot.
3. I tried with window size 10 and 8. Window size 8 with drop_out fractio of 0.3 seems to be more close with actual over time.
